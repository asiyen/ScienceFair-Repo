two possibilities should be considered for origin of sars cov-2 natural evolution or laboratory creation. in our earlier report titled unusual features of sars cov-2 genome suggesting sophisticated laboratory modification rather than natural evolution and delineation of its probable synthetic route we disproved possibility of sars cov-2 arising naturally through evolution and instead proved that sars cov-2 must have been product of laboratory modification. despite this and similar efforts laboratory creation theory continues to be downplayed or even diminished. this is fundamentally because natural origin theory remains supported by several novel coronaviruses published after start of outbreak. these viruses ratg13 bat coronavirus series of pangolin coronaviruses and rmyn02 bat coronavirus reportedly share high sequence homology with sars cov-2 and have altogether constructed seemingly plausible pathway for natural evolution of sars cov-2. here however we use in depth analyses of available data and literature to prove that these novel animal coronaviruses do not exist in nature and their sequences have been fabricated. in addition we also offer our insights on hypothesis that sars cov-2 may have originated naturally from coronavirus that infected mojiang miners. revelation of these virus fabrications renders natural origin theory unfounded. it also strengthens our earlier assertion that sars cov-2 is product of laboratory modification which can be created in approximately six months using template virus owned by laboratory of peoples liberation army pla. fact that data fabrications were used to cover up true origin of sars cov-2 further implicates that laboratory modification here is beyond simple gain of function research. scale and coordinated nature of this scientific fraud signifies degree of corruption in fields of academic research and public health. as result of such corruption damages have been made both to reputation of scientific community and to well being of global community. importantly while sars cov-2 meets criteria of bioweapon specified by pla its impact is well beyond what is conceived for typical bioweapon. in addition records indicate that unleashing of this weaponized pathogen should have been intentional rather than accidental. we therefore define sars cov-2 as anunrestricted bioweaponand current pandemic result ofunrestricted biowarfare. we further suggest that investigations should be carried out on suspected government and individuals and responsible ones be held accountable for this brutal attack on global community. |0

in the face of the covid-19 crisis we are all vulnerable. the virushas shown that it does not discriminate butmany refugees those forciblydisplaced thestatelessandmigrantsare at heightened risk. three quarters of the worlds refugees and many migrants are hosted in developing regions where health systems are already overwhelmed and under capacitated. many live in overcrowded camps settlements makeshift shelters orreception centers where theylackadequate access to health services clean water and sanitation. the situation for refugees and migrants held in formal and informal places of detention in cramped and unsanitary conditions is particularly worrying.considering the lethal consequences a covid-19 outbreak would have they should be releasedwithout delay. migrant children and their families and those detained without a sufficient legal basis should be immediately released. this disease can be controlled only if there is an inclusive approachwhich protects every individuals rights to life and health. migrants and refugees are disproportionately vulnerable to exclusion stigma and discrimination particulary when undocumented. to avert a catastrophe governments must do all they can to protect the rights and the health ofeveryone.protectingthe rights and the health of all people will in fact help control the spread of the virus. it is vital that everyone including all migrants and refugees are ensured equal access to health services and are effectively included in national responses to covid-19 including prevention testing and treatment. inclusion will help not only to protect the rights of refugees and migrants but will also serve to protect public health and stem the global spread of covid-19. while many nationsprotect and host refugee and migrant populations they are often not equipped to respondto crises such as covid-19. to ensure refugees and migrants have adequate access to national health services states may need additional financial support. this is where the worlds financial institutions can play a leading role in making funds available. while countries are closing their borders and limiting cross border movements there are ways to manage border restrictions in a manner which respects international human rights and refugee protection standards including the principle of non refoulement through quarantine and health checks. more than ever as covid-19 poses a global threat to our collective humanity our primary focus should be on the preservation of life regardless of status. this crisis demands a coherent effective international approach that leaves no one behind. at this crucial moment we all need to rally around a common objective fighting this deadly virus. manyrefugees displaced stateless peopleand migrants have skills and resources that can also be part of the solution. we can not allow fearorintoleranceto undermine rightsor compromise the effectiveness of responses to the global pandemic.we are all in this together.we can only defeat this virus when each and every one of us is protected. |1

the covid-19 pandemic is having a devastating impact across the world. efforts to contain the coronavirus are vital to the health of the worlds population but they are also exposing children to increased risk of violence including maltreatment gender based violence and sexual exploitation. as leaders of organisations committed to ending violence against children we come together in solidarity to share our deep concern call for action and pledge our support to protect children from violence and reduce the impact of covid-19 on children in every country and community. a third of the global population is on covid-19 lockdown and school closures have impacted more than 1.5 billion children. movement restrictions loss of income isolation overcrowding and high levels of stress and anxiety are increasing the likelihood that children experience and observe physical psychological and sexual abuse at home particularly those children already living in violent or dysfunctional family situations. and while online communities have become central to maintain many childrens learning support and play it is also increasing their exposure to cyberbullying risky online behavior and sexual exploitation.the situation is aggravated by childrens lack of access to schoolfriends teachers social workers and the safe space and services that schools provide. the most vulnerable children including refugees migrants and children who are internally displaced deprived of liberty living without parental care living on the street and in urban slums with disabilities and living in conflict affected areas are a particular concern. for many growing economic vulnerability will increase the threat of child labour child marriage and child trafficking. we must act now. together we call on governments the international community and leaders in every sector to urgently respond with a united effort to protect children from the heightened risk of violence exploitation and abuse as part of the broader response to covid-19.governments have a central role to play. they must ensure that covid-19 prevention and response plans integrate age appropriate and gender sensitive measures to protect all children from violence neglect and abuse. child protection services and workers must be designated as essential and resourced accordingly. working with and supporting governments our collective response must include maintaining essential health and social welfare services including mental health and psychosocial support providing child protection case management and emergency alternative care arrangements ensuring social protection for the most vulnerable children and households continuing care and protection for children in institutions and communicating with and engaging parents caregivers and children themselves with evidence based information and advice. national helplines school counsellors and other child friendly reporting mechanisms enable children in distress to reach out for help and must be adapted to the challenges of covid-19. given the heightened risks of online harms technology companies and telecoms providers must do everything they can to keep children safe online. this includes providing access to cost free child helplines age appropriate services and safe e education platforms and using their platforms to share child online safety advice. they must also do more to detect and stop harmful activity against children online including grooming and the creation and distribution of child sexual abuse images and videos. as global organisations working to end violence against children we will continue to advocate for and invest in effective child protection solutions. we will collectively develop and share technical resources and guidance for policymakers practitioners parents caregivers and children themselves. and we will support the courageous health child protection and humanitarian professionals working around the clock to keep children safe during these unprecedented times. in recent years the global community has made significant gains in protecting children from violence. we must not allow those gains to be lost during the current turmoil. we must do all we can to keep children safe now. and we must plan ahead together so that once the immediate health crisis is over we can get back on track towards the goal of ending all forms of violence abuse and neglect of children. |1

on 8 may 1980 the 33rd world health assembly officially declared the world and all its peoples have won freedom from smallpox.the declaration marked the end of a disease that had plagued humanity for at least 3 000 years killing 300 million people in the 20thcentury alone.it was ended thanks to a 10-year global effort spearheaded by the world health organization that involved thousands of health workers around the world to administer half a billion vaccinations to stamp out smallpox.the us$ 300 m price tag to eradicate smallpox saves the world well over us$ 1 billion every year since 1980.speaking at a virtual event hosted at who hq involving key players in the eradication effort who director general dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus said as the world confronts the covid-19 pandemic humanitys victory over smallpox is a reminder of what is possible when nations come together to fight a common health threat.the world got rid of smallpox thanks to an incredible demonstration of global solidarity and because it had a safe and effective vaccine. solidarity plus science equalled solution!dr tedros highlighted that smallpox eradication also offers hope for efforts to eliminate other infectious diseases including polio which is now endemic in just two countries. to date 187 countries territories and areas have been certified free of guinea worm disease with seven more to go. and the fight against malaria has so far resulted in 38 countries and territories certified as malaria free. in the case of tuberculosis tb 57 countries and territories with low tb incidence areon track to reach tb elimination.at the event dr tedros unveiled a commemorative postal stamp to recognize the global solidarity that drove the initiative and honour the efforts of health workers who ensured its success.the stamp developed by the united nations postal administration unpa in collaboration with who signifies what national unity and global solidary can achieve. numerous countries such as guinea india nigeria philippines togo and others issued smallpox stamps to show support for and raise awareness about who s intensified smallpox eradication programme launched in 1967.who regional director for africa dr matshidiso moetis earliest memories of smallpox is of her father. i was visiting who headquarters and i saw a photo of my dad standing with the other experts on the global commission. i remember him going out doing follow up visits with patients. he often would go with a driver and disappear into the bush for days. i felt in awe of his tireless work. the strategies used to eradicate smallpox still apply today.lessons learned from smallpox are used today to respond to disease outbreaks. for example house to house active case finding underpins the polio eradication programme and ring vaccination of contacts is helping to combat the spread of the ebola virus disease. similarly surveillance case finding testing contact tracing quarantine and communication campaigns to dispel misinformation are central to controlling covid-19 explained david heymann professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the london school of hygiene tropical medicine lshtm and distinguished fellow global health securityat chatham house london.following smallpox eradication who and unicef launched the expanded programme on immunization under which 85 of the worlds children are vaccinated and protected from debilitating diseases.with the potential of a covid-19 vaccine ahead ensuring sufficient supplies and reaching people in hard to reach places is a high priority. addressing vaccine hesitancy poses a significant challenge to stop the virus. access to accurate public health information and education is critical to ensure that the public has the facts to keep themselves and others safe.to permanently commemorate the eradication of smallpox and the lessons learned on a global scale rather than every 10-years who is calling museums exhibition companies designers curators and associations to develop an immersive interactive and educational exhibition on smallpox and its relevance for covid-19 and global health security. the exhibition which will be unveiled later this year will promote a better understanding of public health and empower people to keep informed and safe during a pandemic.notes to the mediasmallpox stampthe smallpox stamp

the covid-19 pandemic is highlighting the need to urgently increase investment in services for mental health or risk a massive increase in mental health conditions in the coming months according to a policy brief on covid-19 and mental health issued by the united nations today.the impact of the pandemic on peoples mental health is already extremely concerning said dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus director general of the world health organization. social isolation fear of contagion and loss of family members is compounded by the distress caused by loss of income and often employment.depression and anxiety are increasingreports already indicate an increase in symptoms of depression and anxiety in a number of countries. a study in ethiopia in april 2020 reported a 3-fold increase in the prevalence of symptoms of depression compared to estimates from ethiopia before the epidemic.specific population groups are at particular risk of covid related psychological distress. frontline health care workers faced with heavy workloads life or death decisions and risk of infection are particularly affected. during the pandemic in china health care workers have reported high rates of depression 50 anxiety 45 and insomnia 34 and in canada 47 of health care workers have reported a need for psychological support.children and adolescents are also at risk. parents in italy and spain have reported that their children have had difficulties concentrating as well as irritability restlessness and nervousness. stay at home measures have come with a heightened risk of children witnessing or suffering violence and abuse. children with disabilities children in crowded settings and those who live and work on the streets are particularly vulnerable.other groups that are at particular risk are women particularly those who are juggling home schooling working from home and household tasks older persons and people with pre existing mental health conditions. a study carried out with young people with a history of mental health needs living in the uk reports that 32 of them agreed that the pandemic had made their mental health much worse.an increase in alcohol consumption is another area of concern for mental health experts. statistics from canada report that 20 of 15 49 year olds have increased their alcohol consumption during the pandemic.mental health services interruptedthe increase in people in need of mental health or psychosocial support has been compounded by the interruption to physical and mental health services in many countries. in addition to the conversion of mental health facilities into care facilities for people with covid-19 care systems have been affected by mental health staff being infected with the virus and the closing of face to face services. community services such as self help groups for alcohol and drug dependence have in many countries been unable to meet for several months.it is now crystal clear that mental health needs must be treated as a core element of our response to and recovery from the covid-19 pandemic said dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus. this is a collective responsibility of governments and civil society with the support of the whole united nations system. a failure to take peoples emotional well being seriously will lead to long term social and economic costs to society.finding ways to provide servicesin concrete terms it is critical that people living with mental health conditions have continued access to treatment. changes in approaches to provision of mental health care and psychosocial support are showing signs of success in some countries. in madrid when more than 60 of mental health beds were converted to care for people with covid-19 where possible people with severe conditions were moved to private clinics to ensure continuity of care. local policy makers identified emergency psychiatry as an essential service to enable mental health care workers to continue outpatient services over the phone. home visits were organized for the most serious cases. teams from egypt kenya nepal malaysia and new zealand among others have reported creating increased capacity of emergency telephone lines for mental health to reach people in need.support for community actions that strengthen social cohesion and reduce loneliness particularly for the most vulnerable such as older people must continue. such support is required from government local authorities the private sector and members of the general public with initiatives such as provision of food parcels regular phone check ins with people living alone and organization of online activities for intellectual and cognitive stimulation.an opportunity to build back betterthe scaling up and reorganization of mental health services that is now needed on a global scale is an opportunity to build a mental health system that is fit for the future said dvora kestel director of the department of mental health and substance use at who. this means developing and funding national plans that shift care away from institutions to community services ensuring coverage for mental health conditions in health insurance packages and building the human resource capacity to deliver quality mental health and social care in the community. |1
who to roll out learning and monitoring tools to improve service provision during pandemicgeneva 31 august 2020 world health organization who today published first indicative survey on impact of covid-19 on health systems based on 105 countries reports. data collected from five regions over period from march to june 2020 illustrate that almost every country 90 experienced disruption to its health services with low- and middle income countries reporting greatest difficulties. most countries reported that many routine and elective services have been suspended while critical care such as cancer screening and treatment and hiv therapy has seen high risk interruptions in low income countries. survey shines light on cracks in our health systems but it also serves to inform new strategies to improve healthcare provision during pandemic and beyond said dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus who director general. covid-19 should be lesson to all countries that health is not either or equation. we must better prepare for emergencies but also keep investing in health systems that fully respond to peoples needs throughout life course. "services hit across board based on reports from key informants countries on average experienced disruptions in 50 of set of 25 tracer services. most frequently disrupted areas reported included routine immunization outreach services 70 and facility based services 61 non communicable diseases diagnosis and treatment 69 family planning and contraception 68 treatment for mental health disorders 61 cancer diagnosis and treatment 55%).countries also reported disruptions in malaria diagnosis and treatment 46 tuberculosis case detection and treatment 42 and antiretroviral treatment 32. while some areas of health care such as dental care and rehabilitation may have been deliberately suspended in line with government protocols disruption of many of other services is expected to have harmful effects on population health in short- medium- and long-term.potentially life saving emergency services were disrupted in almost quarter of responding countries. disruptions to 24-hour emergency room services for example were affected in 22 of countries urgent blood transfusions were disrupted in 23 of countries emergency surgery was affected in 19 of countries.disruption due to mix of supply and demand side factors. 76 of countries reported reductions in outpatient care attendance due to lower demand and other factors such as lockdowns and financial difficulties. most commonly reported factor on supply side was cancellation of elective services 66. other factors reported by countries included staff redeployment to provide covid-19 relief unavailability of services due to closings and interruptions in supply of medical equipment and health products.adapting service delivery strategies. many countries have started to implement some of who recommended strategies to mitigate service disruptions such as triaging to identify priorities shifting to on line patient consultations changes to prescribing practices and supply chain and public health information strategies. however only 14 of countries reported removal of user fees which who recommends to offset potential financial difficulties for patients.the pulse survey also provides indication of countries experiences in adapting strategies to mitigate impact on service provision. despite limitations of such survey it highlights need to improve real time monitoring of changes in service delivery and utilization as outbreak is likely to wax and wane over next months and to adapt solutions accordingly. to that end who will continue to work with countries and to provide supportive tools to address fallout from covid-19. given countries urgent demand for assistance during pandemic response who is developing covid19 health services learning hub web based platform that will allow sharing of experiences and learning from innovative country practices that can inform collective global response.who is also devising additional surveys at sub national level and in health facilities to gauge longer term impact of disruptions and help countries weigh benefits and risks of pursuing different mitigation strategies.note to editorsthe survey rapid assessment of continuity of essential health services during covid-19 pandemic hyperlink was conducted in 159 countries all who regions except americas. 105 responses were received 66 response rate from senior ministry of health officials covering period from march to june 2020. purpose of survey was to gain insights and perspectives on both impact of covid-19 pandemic on up to 25 essential health services in countries and how countries are adapting strategies to maintain essential services.while pulse surveys have some limitations strength of this effort is that it is comprehensive looking at 25 core health services as opposed to single topic surveys and representing disruptions to these services in comparable way across over 100 countries. it reveals that even robust health systems can be rapidly overwhelmed and compromised by covid-19 outbreak reinforcing need for sustained data collection and strategic adaptations to ensure maintenance of essential care provision.links surveyoperational guidance for maintaining essential services during outbreak. |1
seventy three countries have warned that they are at risk of stock outs of antiretroviral arv medicines as result of covid-19 pandemic according to new who survey conducted ahead of international aids societys biannual conference. twenty four countries reported having either critically low stock of arvs or disruptions in supply of these life saving medicines. survey follows modelling exercise convened by who and unaids in may which forecasted that six month disruption in access to arvs could lead to doubling in aids related deaths in sub saharan africa in 2020 alone. in 2019 estimated 8.3 million people were benefiting from arvs in 24 countries now experiencing supply shortages. this represents about one third 33 of all people taking hiv treatment globally. while there is no cure for hiv arvs can control virus and prevent onward sexual transmission to other people.a failure of suppliers to deliver arvs on time and shut down of land and air transport services coupled with limited access to health services within countries as result of pandemic were among causes cited for disruptions in survey.;the findings of this survey are deeply concerning said dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus who director general. countries and their development partners must do all they can to ensure that people who need hiv treatment continue to access it. we can not let covid-19 pandemic undo hard won gains in global response to this disease. stalled progressaccording to data released today from unaids and who new hiv infections fell by 39 between 2000 and 2019. hiv related deaths fell by 51 over same time period and some 15 million lives were saved through use of antiretroviral therapy. however progresstowards global targets is stalling. over last two years annual number of new hiv infections has plateaued at 1.7 million and there was only modest reduction in hiv related death from 730 000 in 2018 to 690 000 in 2019. despite steady advances in scaling up treatment coverage with more than 25 million people in need of arvs receiving them in 2019 key 2020 global targets will be missed. hiv prevention and testing services are not reaching groups that need them most. improved targeting of proven prevention and testing services will be critical to reinvigorate global response to hiv. who guidance and country actioncovid-19 risks exacerbating situation. who recently developed guidance for countries on how to safely maintain access to essential health services during pandemic including for all people living with or affected by hiv. guidance encourages countries to limit disruptions in access to hiv treatment through multi month dispensing policy whereby medicines are prescribed for longer periods of time up to six months. to date 129 countries have adopted this policy. countries are also mitigating impact of disruptions by working to maintain flights and supply chains engaging communities in delivery of hiv medicines and working with manufacturers to overcome logistics challenges.new opportunities to treat hiv in young childrenat ias conference who will highlight how global progress in reducing hiv related deaths can be accelerated by stepping up support and services for populations disproportionately impacted by epidemic including young children. in 2019 there were estimated 95 000 hiv related deaths and 150 000 new infections among children. only about half 53 of children in need of antiretroviral therapy were receiving it. lack of optimal medicines with suitable pediatric formulations has been longstanding barrier to improving health outcomes for children living with hiv.last month who welcomed decision by u.s. food and drug administration to approve new 5 mg formulation of dolutegravir dtg for infants and children older than 4 weeks and weighing more than 3 kg. this decision will ensure that all children have rapid access to optimal drug that to date has only been available for adults adolescents and older children. who is committed to fast tracking prequalification of dtg as generic drug so that it can be used as soon as possible by countries to save lives. through collaboration of multiple partners we are likely to see generic versions of dolutegravir for children by early 2021 allowing for rapid reduction in cost of this medicine said dr meg doherty director of department of global hiv hepatitis and sti programmes at who. this will give us another new tool to reach children living with hiv and keep them alive and healthy.tackling opportunistic infectionsmany hiv related deaths result from infections that take advantage of individuals weakened immune system. these include bacterial infections such as tuberculosis viral infections like hepatitis and covid-19 parasitic infections such as toxoplasmosis and fungal infections including histoplasmosis.today who is releasing new guidelines for diagnosis and management of histoplasmosis among people living with hiv. histoplasmosis is highly prevalent in who region of americas where as many as 15 600 new cases and 4500 deaths are reported each year among people living with hiv. many of these deaths could be prevented through timely diagnosis and treatment of disease.in recent years development of highly sensitive diagnostic tests has allowed for rapid and accurate confirmation of histoplasmosis and earlier initiation of treatment. however innovative diagnostics and optimal treatments for this disease are not yet widely available in resource limited settings. |1

all over the world the covid-19 pandemic is causing significant loss of life disrupting livelihoods and threatening the recent advances in health and progress towards global development goals highlighted in the 2020 world health statistics published by the world health organization who today.the good news is that people around the world are living longer and healthier lives. the bad news is the rate of progress is too slow to meet the sustainable development goals and will be further thrown off track by covid-19 said dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus who director-general.the pandemic highlights the urgent need for all countries to invest in strong health systems and primary health care as the best defense against outbreaks like covid-19 and against the many other health threats that people around the world face every day. health systems and health security are two sides of the same coin.whos world health statistics an annual check up on the worlds health reports progress against a series of key health and health service indicators revealing some important lessons in terms of progress made towards the sustainable development goals and gaps to fill.life expectancy and healthy life expectancy have increased but unequally.the biggest gains were reported in low income countries which saw life expectancy rise 21 or 11 years between 2000 and 2016 compared with an increase of 4 or 3 years in higher income countries).one driver of progress in lower income countries was improved access to services to prevent and treat hiv malaria and tuberculosis as well as anumber of neglected tropical diseases such as guinea worm. another was better maternal and child healthcare which led to a halving of child mortality between 2000 and 2018.but in a number of areas progress has been stalling. immunization coverage has barely increased in recent years and there are fears that malaria gains may be reversed. and there is an overall shortage of services within and outside the health system to prevent and treat noncommunicable diseases ncds such as cancer diabetes heart and lung disease and stroke. in 2016 71 per cent of all deaths worldwide were attributable to ncds with the majority of the 15 million premature deaths 85 occurring in low and middle income countries.this uneven progress broadly mirrors inequalities in access to quality health services. only between one third and one half the worlds population was able to obtain essential health services in 2017. service coverage in low- and middle income countries remains well below coverage in wealthier ones as do health workforce densities. in more than 40 of all countries there are fewer than 10 medical doctors per 10 000 people. over 55 of countries have fewer than 40 nursing and midwifery personnel per 10 000 people.the inability to pay for healthcare is another major challenge for many. on current trends who estimates that this year 2020 approximately 1 billion people almost 13 per cent of the global population will be spending at least 10 of their household budgets on health care. the majority of these people live in lower middle income countries.the covid-19 pandemic highlights the need to protect people from health emergencies as well as to promote universal health coverage and healthier populations to keep people from needing health services through multisecotral interventions like improving basic hygiene and sanitation said dr samira asma assistant director general at who.in 2017 more than half 55 of the global population was estimated to lack access to safely managed sanitation services and more than one quarter 29 lacked safely managed drinking water. in the same year two in five households globally 40 lacked basic handwashing facilities with soap and water in their home.the world health statistics also highlight the need for stronger data and health information systems. uneven capacities to collect and use accurate timely and comparable health statistics undermining countries ability to understand population health trends develop appropriate policies allocate resources and prioritize interventions.for almost a fifth of countries over half of the key indicators have no recent primary or direct underlying data another major challenge in enabling countries to prepare for prevent and respond to health emergencies such as the ongoing covid-19 pandemic. who is therefore supporting countries in strengthening surveillance and data and health information systems so they can measure their status and manage improvements.the message from this report is clear as the world battles the most serious pandemic in 100 years just a decade away from the sdg deadline we must act together to strengthen primary health care and focus on the most vulnerable among us in order to eliminate the gross inequalities that dictate who lives a long healthy life and who does nt added asma. we will only succeed in doing this by helping countries to improve their data and health information systems.note for editorsthe world health statistics have been compiled primarily from publications and databases produced and maintained by who or by united nations un groups of which who is a member such as the un interagency group for child mortality estimation. in addition some statistics have been derived from data produced and maintained by other international organizations such as the un department of economic and social affairs and its population division. the global health observatory database contains additional details about the health related sdg indicators as well as interactive visualizations. |1
covid-19 pandemic has disrupted or halted critical mental health services in 93 of countries worldwide while demand for mental health is increasing according to new who survey. survey of 130 countries provides first global data showing devastating impact of covid-19 on access to mental health services and underscores urgent need for increased funding.the survey was published ahead of who s big event for mental health global online advocacy event on 10 october that will bring together world leaders celebrities and advocates to call for increased mental health investments in wake of covid-19.who has previously highlighted chronic underfunding of mental health prior to pandemic countries were spending less than 2 per cent of their national health budgets on mental health and struggling to meet their populations needs.and pandemic is increasing demand for mental health services. bereavement isolation loss of income and fear are triggering mental health conditions or exacerbating existing ones. many people may be facing increased levels of alcohol and drug use insomnia and anxiety. meanwhile covid-19 itself can lead to neurological and mental complications such as delirium agitation and stroke. people with pre existing mental neurological or substance use disorders are also more vulnerable to sars cov-2 infection they may stand higher risk of severe outcomes and even death.good mental health is absolutely fundamental to overall health and well being said dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus director general of world health organization. covid-19 has interrupted essential mental health services around world just when they re needed most. world leaders must move fast and decisively to invest more in life saving mental health programmes during pandemic and beyond. survey finds major disruptions to critical mental health services survey was conducted from june to august 2020 among 130 countries across who s six regions. it evaluates how provision of mental neurological and substance use services has changed due to covid-19 types of services that have been disrupted and how countries are adapting to overcome these challenges.countries reported widespread disruption of many kinds of critical mental health services over 60 reported disruptions to mental health services for vulnerable people including children and adolescents 72 older adults 70 and women requiring antenatal or postnatal services 61%).67 saw disruptions to counseling and psychotherapy 65 to critical harm reduction services and 45 to opioid agonist maintenance treatment for opioid dependence.more than third 35 reported disruptions to emergency interventions including those for people experiencing prolonged seizures severe substance use withdrawal syndromes and delirium often sign of serious underlying medical condition.30 reported disruptions to access for medications for mental neurological and substance use disorders.around three quarters reported at least partial disruptions to school and workplace mental health services 78 and 75 respectively).while many countries 70 have adopted telemedicine or teletherapy to overcome disruptions to in person services there are significant disparities in uptake of these interventions. more than 80 of high income countries reported deploying telemedicine and teletherapy to bridge gaps in mental health compared with less than 50 of low income countries.who has issued guidance to countries on how to maintain essential services including mental health services during covid-19 and recommends that countries allocate resources to mental health as integral component of their response and recovery plans. organization also urges countries to monitor changes and disruptions in services so that they can address them as required.although 89 of countries reported in survey that mental health and psychosocial support is part of their national covid-19 response plans only 17 of these countries have full additional funding for covering these activities.this all highlights need for more money for mental health. as pandemic continues even greater demand will be placed on national and international mental health programmes that have suffered from years of chronic underfunding. spending 2 of national health budgets on mental health is not enough. international funders also need to do more mental health still receives less than 1 of international aid earmarked for health.those who do invest in mental health will reap rewards. pre covid-19 estimates reveal that nearly us$ 1 trillion in economic productivity is lost annually from depression and anxiety alone. however studies show that every us$ 1 spent on evidence based care for depression and anxiety returns us$5.note on world mental health day

"Safety and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273 vaccine in older adults. Anderson et al. NEJM, • After two-doses of an mRNA vaccine, antibody levels to the receptor binding domain (RBD) were higher in vaccinated individuals compared to the antibody levels among mostly mild and moderately ill COVID-19 individuals who donated convalescent serum (controls) (Figure 1). o Antibody levels were similar to those in younger adults who received the vaccine in another study (Figure 1). • Adverse events were generally mild or moderate, dose-dependent, and more commonly detected after second vaccine dose (Figure 2). • Antiviral T cell responses to the vaccine were detected in most participants., Risk of COVID-19 related death among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma prescribed inhaled corticosteroids: An observational cohort study using the OpenSAFELY platform. Schultze et al. Lancet Respiratory Medicine, • People with COPD who were prescribed ICS with other inhaled medications were at increased risk of COVID-19-related death compared with those prescribed other inhaled medications (long-acting β agonists [LABA] and long-acting muscarinic antagonists [LAMA]), (adjusted HR [aHR] 1.39, 95% CI 1.10–1.76) (Figure 1A). • People with asthma who were prescribed high-dose ICS were at an increased risk of COVID-19 related death compared with those prescribed short-acting β agonists (SABA) only (aHR 1.55, 95% CI 1.10–2.18) (Figure 1B). o People with asthma prescribed low- or medium-dose ICS were not at increased risk of death (aHR 1.14, 95% CI 0.85–1.54) compared with those prescribed SABAs only (Figure 1B). • Sensitivity analyses found that the apparent associations between ICS and COVID-19-related death in persons with COPD or asthma could be explained by underlying health differences between people prescribed ICS and those prescribed other respiratory medications., Mass screening of asymptomatic persons for SARS-CoV-2 using saliva. Yokota et al. Clinical Infectious Diseases, • Among asymptomatic persons, the sensitivity of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and saliva specimen tests was 86% (90% CI 77-93%) and 92% (90% CI 83-97%), respectively (Table). o Specificity for both specimen types was >99%. • There was high concordance between results from using NPS and saliva specimens, ranging from 0.934 to 0.999 when SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was varied from 0% to 30%., Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a large nationwide sample of patients on dialysis in the USA: A cross-sectional study. Anand et al. Lancet, • Less than 10% of US adults on dialysis had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, less than 10% of those with antibodies were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. • Risk of seropositivity was increased for those who lived in (Figure): o non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic neighborhoods (OR 3.9 95% CI 3.4-4.6) o neighborhoods with highest population density compared to those with the lowest density (OR 10.3, 95% CI 8.7-12.2) • When compared with descriptive measures of SARS-CoV-2 spread, there was a high correlation of seroprevalence with deaths per 100, 000 population (Spearman’s ρ = 0.77)., Susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection among children and adolescents compared with adults. Viner et al. JAMA Pediatrics, • In 15 contact-tracing studies, children and adolescents (&lt;20 years) had lower susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection than adults (≥20 years), (pooled OR, 0.56 95% CI 0.37–0.85). o Susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection among children (&lt;10-14 years) was significantly lower than for adults (pooled OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.33–0.82) (Figure 1). o Susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection adolescents (10–19 years) was not significantly different than for adults (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.64–2.36). • Most population screening studies found lower seroprevalence in children than in adults. o Seroprevalence appeared similar in adolescents and adults., Asymptomatic reinfection in two healthcare workers from India with genetically distinct SARS-CoV-2. Gupta et al. Clinical Infectious Diseases, • Asymptomatic reinfection was identified in two healthcare workers (HCWs) with genetically distinct SARS-CoV-2 viruses (Figure 1). • Both individuals had higher viral loads during reinfection than during the first infection. o Ct values during the first and second infections were 36 and 16.6 for the first individual, and 28.2 and 16.9 for the second individual, respectively., Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support in COVID-19: an international cohort study of the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization registry.

25 september 2020 fragile gains made to advance women and childrens health are threatened by conflict climate crisis and covid-19 according to new report from every woman every child.protect progress rise refocus recover 2020 highlights that since every woman every child movement was launched 10 years ago spearheaded by united nations secretary general there has been remarkable progress in improving health of worlds women children and adolescents. for example under five deaths reached all time recorded low in 2019 and more than 1 billion children were vaccinated over past decade. coverage of immunization skilled birth attendant and access to safe drinking water reached over 80 per cent. maternal deaths declined by 35 per cent since 2000 with most significant declines occurring from 2010. estimated 25 million child marriages were also prevented over past decade.however conflict climate instability and covid-19 pandemic are putting health and well being of all children and adolescents at risk. covid-19 crisis in particular is exacerbating existing inequities with reported disruptions in essential health interventions disproportionately impacting most vulnerable women and children. at height of pandemic lockdowns schools were closed in 192 countries affecting 1.6 billion students. domestic violence and abuse of girls and women increased. poverty and hunger are also on rise.even before covid-19 pandemic child under age of five died every six seconds somewhere around world said henrietta fore unicef executive director. millions of children living in conflict zones and fragile settings face even greater hardship with onset of pandemic. we need to work collectively to meet immediate needs caused by pandemic while also strengthening health systems. only then can we protect and save lives.in 2019 5.2 million children under age of 5 and 1 million adolescents died of preventable causes. every 13 seconds newborn baby died. every hour 33 women did not survive childbirth and 33.000 girls day were forced into marriages usually to much older men. report examines deep rooted inequities which continue to deprive women children and adolescents of their rights noting birthplace as significant determinant of survival. in 2019 82 percent of under-5 deaths and 86 percent of maternal deaths were concentrated in sub saharan africa and south asia. nine in 10 paediatric hiv infections occurred in sub saharan africa. maternal newborn child and adolescent mortality rates were substantially higher in countries chronically affected by conflict.for too long health and rights of women children and adolescents have received insufficient attention and services have been inadequately resourced said former prime minister of new zealand and board chair of partnership for maternal newborn and child health helen clark. we call on all partners to work together to support governments to strengthen health systems and tackle inequities that constrain progress.the report calls upon global community to fight covid-19 while honoring and respecting commitments that can improve lives of women and children and not widen gap between promise and reality. covid-19 pandemic threatens to turn back clock on years of progress in reproductive maternal child and adolescent health. this is unacceptable said muhammad ali pate global director for health nutrition and population at world bank group and director global financing facility. gff partnership will double down on its efforts to engage with partners and countries and honor global commitment to ensure that all women adolescents and children can access quality affordable health care they need to survive and thrive.the past decade of progress to advance health of women children and adolescents must be protected from impact of pandemic and responses to it report says. rapid reversal of hard fought progress in womens childrens and adolescents health is real threat said ties boerma director of countdown to 2030 for reproductive maternal newborn child and adolescent health. as intensive tracking of covid-19 pandemic tells us timely local data are necessary to be able to target actions and prevent rising inequalities. global and country investments in local health information systems are much needed to guide response and protect progress. without intensified efforts to combat preventable child deaths 48 million children under age 5 could die between 2020 and 2030. almost half of these deaths will be newborns. report advocates for countries to continue investing in health of all women children and adolescents in all crises. "as we respond to covid-19 and reimagine better future with sustained peace including at home we must repeat unequivocally that rights of women and girls are not negotiable. even in times of crisis especially in times of crisis their sexual and reproductive health and rights must be safeguarded at all costs said natalia kanem unfpa executive director.the report argues that every woman every child movement is more critical than ever as we step into sdg decade of action in midst of worst global health crisis of generation. momentum of movement must continue to champion multilaterialism to mobilize action across all sectors to safeguard tremendous investments and gains realized by commitments since its launch 10 years ago and to protect health and well being of every woman child and adolescent everywhere. "there is no doubt that pandemic has set back global efforts to improve health and well being of women and children but that should only serve to strengthen our resolve said dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus who director general. our joint action under every woman every child movement is more important than ever. we now must renew our commitment to healthier safer fairer and more sustainable world for women children and future generations.link to report microsite http://protect.everywomaneverychild.org link to who global strategy for womens children and adolescents health data portal https://www.who.int data maternal newborn child adolescent global strategy data. |1

23 march 2020 geneva new world health organization who guidance will help countries accelerate efforts to stop people with tuberculosis tb infection becoming sick with tb by giving them preventive treatment.a quarter of the worlds population is estimated to be infected with tb bacteria. these people are neither sick nor contagious. however they are at greater risk of developing tb disease especially those with weakened immunity. offering them tb preventive treatment will not only protect them from becoming sick but also cut down on the risk of transmission in the community. as we mark world tb day 2020 the disease remains the worlds top infectious killer. in 2018 10 million people fell ill with tb worldwide and 1.5 million people lost their lives to this disease. covid-19 is highlighting just how vulnerable people with lung diseases and weakened immune systems can be said dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus who director general. the world committed to end tb by 2030 improving prevention is key to making this happen. millions of people need to be able to take tb preventive treatment to stop the onset of disease avert suffering and save lives".dr tedros highlighted the importance to continue efforts to tackle longstanding health problems including tbduring global outbreaks such as covid-19. at the same time programmes already in place to combat tb and other major infectious diseases can be leveraged to make the response to covid-19 more effective and rapid.although some progress has been made towards targets set at the un high level meeting on tb in 2018 tb preventive treatment has been largely neglected. global leaders committed to ensuring access to tb preventive treatment to at least 24 million contacts of people with active tb and 6 million people living with hiv by 2022. to date only a fraction of that target has been reached with countries putting less than 430,000 contacts and 1.8 million people on tb preventive treatment in 2018. tb remains the top cause of death among people with hiv. tb preventive treatment works synergistically with antiretroviral therapy to prevent tb and save lives. reinvigorated efforts by governments health services partners donors and civil society will be needed to increase access to tb preventive treatment to the levels targeted. the new consolidated guidelines recommend a range of innovative approaches to scale up access to tb preventive treatment who recommends a scale up of tb preventive treatment among populations at highest risk including household contacts of tb patients people living with hiv and other people at risk with lowered immunity or living in crowded settings. who recommends an integration of tb preventive treatment services into ongoing case finding efforts for active tb. all household contacts of tb patients and people living with hiv are recommended to be screened for active tb. if active tb is ruled out they should be initiated on tb preventive treatment. who recommends that either a tuberculin skin test or interferon gamma release assay igra be used to test for tb infection. both tests are helpful to find people more likely to benefit from tb preventive treatment but should not become a barrier to scale up access. testing for tb infection is not required before starting tb preventive treatment in people living with hiv and children under 5 years who are contacts of people with active tb.who recommends new shorter options for preventive treatment in addition to the widely used 6 months of daily isoniazid. the shorter options that are now recommended range from a 1 month daily regimen of rifapentine plus isoniazid to 3 months weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid 3 months daily rifampicin plus isoniazid or 4 months of daily rifampicin alone.as people around the globe come together to commemorate world tb day who is calling on governments affected communities civil society organizations health care providers donors partners and the industry to unite forces and step up the tb response notably for tb preventive treatment to ensure no one is left behind said dr tereza kasaeva director of who s global tb programme. the new who guidance shows the way forward for millions to rapidly access new tools and shorter safer options for preventive treatment. the time for action is now. tb preventive treatment is an affordable intervention that can prevent families from sliding into poverty and preserve the health and economy of whole communities. who anticipates that as new and safer drugs come onto the markets and as prices fall it will become a highly cost effective way to save millions of lives. notes for editors work by who and partnerswho works closely with member states including the us government and technical and funding partners such as unitaid to enhance access to shorter tb preventive treatment regimens. unitaid supported projects such as impaact4 tb and cap tb projects enabled by who with partners in brazil cambodia cameroon cte divoire democratic republic of congo ethiopia ghana india indonesia kenya lesotho malawi mozambique south africa uganda united republic of tanzania and zimbabwe are leading the way. the new treatment options are also now more affordable thanks to the significant price drop of rifapentine a key drug facilitated recently by unitaid the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria and global biopharmaceutical company sanofi along with forthcoming arrangements underway with generic manufacturers. more about the guidelinesthe new consolidated who guidelines come with an operational handbook to help guide countries step by step as they take tb preventive treatment to scale. this includes guidance on how to prioritize and invest from demand creation for tb prevention to supervision and monitoring of the programme. the guidelines and operational handbook are also accompanied by an innovative mobile application prevent tb to help health care workers manage tb preventive treatment in their communities. its online dashboard allows programme managers to visualize and monitor data in real time. the application can be customized by countries to suit their specific settings and is currently being adopted in india and philippines. world tb daythe new guidelines and tools are being released ahead of world tb day. world tb day is observed on march 24 each year to raise public awareness and understanding about the worlds deadliest infectious killer tb and its devastating health social and economic impact on people around the world. under the theme its time the spotlight this year is on urgently accelerating the tb response to save lives and end suffering. |1

Cole et al. American Journal of Infection Control, • 25% increase in hand sanitizer and hand soap use among health care personnel in the second quarter (Q2) of 2020 compared to the first quarter (Q1). • 35% decrease in hospital-acquired multidrug resistant infection rates from 0.3/1, 000 person-days in Q1 to 0.2/1, 000 person-days in Q2, (p = 0.03); specifically: o 80% decrease in vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. o 41% decrease in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. o 21% decrease in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase Enterobacteriaceae infections., SARS-CoV-2 outbreak investigation in a German meat processing plant. Günther et al. EMBO Molecular Medicine, • Based on viral genome relatedness, a cluster of 29 infections among 147 workers from a single shift was attributable to a single index case (Figure). o Follow-up screening and testing identified ongoing transmission with more than 1, 400 cases identified through June. • Workers within an 8-meter radius of the index case were at highest risk for infection (p &lt;0.001). • Infection was associated with working at fixed stations at which air conditioners recirculated air above workers, fans recirculating the air did not have filters and fresh-air exchange rates were low (&lt;1 exchange per hour). • Sharing a bedroom (p = 0.039) and sharing both an apartment and transportation (p = 0.048), were associated with infection., Follow-up of adults with non-critical COVID-19 two months after symptoms&#039; onset. Carvalho-Schneider et al. Clinical Microbiology and Infection, • Two-thirds of non-critical COVID-19 patients experienced prolonged symptoms, and some felt worse later in the disease course than at symptom onset. o Loss of smell and taste were the most frequent persistent symptoms at day 60 (22.7%). • Persisting clinical symptoms were significantly associated with being admitted to the hospital, having an abnormal chest exam (auscultation), and being 40–60 years old at time of symptom onset (Figure)., Neuropathology of patients with COVID-19 in Germany: A post-mortem case series.

Girardin et al. medRxiv, • Of the initial donations of plasma from COVID-19 convalescent patients, 79.5% of specimens that neutralized 50% of virus in a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT50) did so at a plasma IgG titer of at least 1:80, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) minimum titer for convalescent plasma (CP). o 51.4% of specimens with a PRNT50 met the FDA recommended plasma titer of at least 1:160. • At 85 days after the initial donation, only 48.8% of specimens with PRNT50 met the minimum plasma titer cutoff (Figure 1). o The most significant decreases in PRNT50 titer occurred at ≥43 days after initial donation. • When using an FDA-approved IgG test that is a suggested surrogate for virus neutralization, 100% of samples with an IgG signal-to-noise ratio ≥12 (the qualifying cutoff for CP) neutralized virus at a titer ≥1:80 (Figure 2)., Upper respiratory tract levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and duration of viral RNA shedding do not differ between patients with mild and severe/critical COVID-19. Yilmaz et al. Journal of Infectious Diseases, • Highest viral loads were observed early after symptom onset in persons with mild and severe COVID-19 and decreased over time (Figure). • Median duration of viral shedding in individuals with mild and severe COVID-19 was similar, 24 vs 22.5 days, respectively (Figure). • Most mild symptomatic cases (26/34) continued to be PCR-positive for 2 to 14 days after resolution of symptoms., Caregivers&#039; willingness to accept expedited vaccine research during the COVID-19 pandemic–A cross sectional survey. Goldman et al. Clinical Therapeutics, • Less than half (43%) of caregivers reported they were willing to accept a COVID-19 vaccine that is approved via Fast-Track status by the US Food and Drug Administration. • Independent factors associated with willingness to accept expedited vaccine research included: o Children up to date on their vaccination schedule (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.29-2.31, p &lt;0.001). o Being worried that the caregivers themselves were sick with COVID-19 (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.05-1.15, p &lt;0.001). • Mothers were less likely to accept expedited vaccine development than fathers (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.53-0.78)., Influences on attitudes regarding potential COVID-19 vaccination in the United States. Pogue et al. Vaccines., • 69% of respondents indicated they were open to receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. o Positive attitudes towards a COVID-19 vaccine were higher if the vaccine spent longer in clinical testing, had high efficacy, and was developed in the US. o Respondents who are current on vaccines recommended by their physician, whose children are current on vaccines, and who perceive that COVID-19 is an important problem in the US were more likely to indicate that they would take a COVID-19 vaccine. • COVID-19 vaccine attitudes were unrelated to understanding of vaccines, demographics, COVID-19 knowledge, and number of people known with COVID-19 diagnosis., COVID-19, Science"|1

with number of under five deaths at all time recorded low of 5.2 million in 2019 disruptions in child and maternal health services due to covid-19 pandemic are putting millions of additional lives at stake new york/ geneva 9 september 2020 number of global under five deaths dropped to its lowest point on record in 2019 down to 5.2 million from 12.5 million in 1990 according to new mortality estimates released by unicef world health organization who population division of united nations department of economic and social affairs and world bank group. since then however surveys by unicef and who reveal that covid-19 pandemic has resulted in major disruptions to health services that threaten to undo decades of hard won progress. global community has come too far towards eliminating preventable child deaths to allow covid-19 pandemic to stop us in our tracks said henrietta fore unicef executive director. when children are denied access to health services because system is overrun and when women are afraid to give birth at hospital for fear of infection they too may become casualties of covid-19. without urgent investments to re start disrupted health systems and services millions of children under five especially newborns could die. over past 30 years health services to prevent or treat causes of child death such as preterm low birthweight complications during birth neonatal sepsis pneumonia diarrhea and malaria as well as vaccination have played large role in saving millions of lives. now countries worldwide are experiencing disruptions in child and maternal health services such as health checkups vaccinations and prenatal and post natal care due to resource constraints and general uneasiness with using health services due to fear of getting covid-19. unicef survey conducted over summer across 77 countries found that almost 68 per cent of countries reported at least some disruption in health checks for children and immunization services. in addition 63 per cent of countries reported disruptions in antenatal checkups and 59 per cent in post natal care. recent who survey based on responses from 105 countries revealed that 52 per cent of countries reported disruptions in health services for sick children and 51 per cent in services for management of malnutrition. health interventions such as these are critical for stopping preventable newborn and child deaths. for example women who receive care by professional midwives trained according to internationals standards are 16 per cent less likely to lose their baby and 24 per cent less likely to experience pre term birth according to who. fact that today more children live to see their first birthday than any time in history is true mark of what can be achieved when world puts health and well being at centre of our response said dr. tedros adhanom ghebreyesus who director general. now we must not let covid-19 pandemic turn back remarkable progress for our children and future generations. rather its time to use what we know works to save lives and keep investing in stronger resilient health systems. based on responses from countries that participated in unicef and who surveys most commonly cited reasons for health service disruptions included parents avoiding health centers for fear of infection transport restrictions suspension or closure of services and facilities fewer healthcare workers due to diversions or fear of infection due to shortages in personal protective equipment such as masks and gloves and greater financial difficulties. afghanistan bolivia cameroon central african republic libya madagascar pakistan sudan and yemen are among hardest hit countries. seven of nine countries had high child mortality rates of more than 50 deaths per 1000 live births among children under five in 2019. in afghanistan where 1 in 17 children died before reaching age 5 in 2019 ministry of health reported significant reduction in visits to health facilities. out of fear of contracting covid-19 virus families are de prioritizing pre- and post natal care adding to risk faced by pregnant women and newborn babies. even before covid-19 newborns were at highest risk of death. in 2019 newborn baby died every 13 seconds. moreover 47 per cent of all under five deaths occurred in neonatal period up from 40 per cent in 1990. with severe disruptions in essential health services newborn babies could be at much higher risk of dying. for example in cameroon where 1 out of every 38 newborns died in 2019 unicef survey reported estimated 75 per cent disruptions in services for essential newborn care antenatal check ups obstetric care and post natal care. in may initial modelling by johns hopkins university showed that almost 6.000 additional children could die per day due to disruptions due to covid-19. these reports and surveys highlight need for urgent action to restore and improve childbirth services and antenatal and postnatal care for mothers and babies including having skilled health workers to care for them at birth. working with parents to assuage their fears and reassure them is also important. covid-19 pandemic has put years of global progress to end preventable child deaths in serious jeopardy said muhammad ali pate global director for health nutrition and population at world bank. it is essential to protect life saving services which have been key to reducing child mortality. we will continue to work with governments and partners to reinforce healthcare systems to ensure mothers and children get services they need. new report demonstrates ongoing progress worldwide in reducing child mortality said john wilmoth director of population division of united nations department of economic and social affairs. while report highlights negative effects of covid-19 pandemic on interventions that are critical for childrens health it also draws attention to need to redress vast inequities in

geneva new york 15 july 2020 world health organization and unicef warned today of alarming decline in number of children receiving life saving vaccines around world. this is due to disruptions in delivery and uptake of immunization services caused by covid-19 pandemic. according to new data by who and unicef these disruptions threaten to reverse hard won progress to reach more children and adolescents with wider range of vaccines which has already been hampered by decade of stalling coverage. latest data on vaccine coverage estimates from who and unicef for 2019 shows that improvements such as expansion of hpv vaccine to 106 countries and greater protection for children against more diseases are in danger of lapsing. for example preliminary data for first four months of 2020 points to substantial drop in number of children completing three doses of vaccine against diphtheria tetanus and pertussis dtp3. this is first time in 28 years that world could see reduction in dtp3 coverage marker for immunization coverage within and across countries. vaccines are one of most powerful tools in history of public health and more children are now being immunized than ever before said dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus who director general. but pandemic has put those gains at risk. avoidable suffering and death caused by children missing out on routine immunizations could be far greater than covid-19 itself. but it does nt have to be that way. vaccines can be delivered safely even during pandemic and we are calling on countries to ensure these essential life saving programmes continue. covid-19 disruptions due to covid-19 pandemic at least 30 measles vaccination campaigns were or are at risk of being cancelled which could result in further outbreaks in 2020 and beyond. according to new unicef who and gavi pulse survey conducted in collaboration with us centers for disease control sabin vaccine institute and johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health three quarters of 82 countries that responded reported covid-19 related disruptions in their immunization programmes as of may 2020. reasons for disrupted services vary. even when services are offered people are either unable to access them because of reluctance to leave home transport interruptions economic hardships restrictions on movement or fear of being exposed to people with covid-19. many health workers are also unavailable because of restrictions on travel or redeployment to covid response duties as well as lack of protective equipment. covid-19 has made previously routine vaccination daunting challenge said unicef executive director henrietta fore. we must prevent further deterioration in vaccine coverage and urgently resume vaccination programs before childrens lives are threatened by other diseases. we can not trade one health crisis for another. stagnating global coverage rate progress on immunization coverage was stalling before covid-19 hit at 85 per cent for dtp3 and measles vaccines. likelihood that child born today will be fully vaccinated with all globally recommended vaccines by time she reaches age of 5 is less than 20 per cent. in 2019 nearly 14 million children missed out on life saving vaccines such as measles and dtp3. most of these children live in africa and are likely to lack access to other health services. two thirds of them are concentrated in 10 middle- and low income countries angola brazil democratic republic of congo ethiopia india indonesia mexico nigeria pakistan and philippines. children in middle income countries account for increasing share of burden. progress and challenges by country and region there has been some progress. regional coverage for third dose of dtp in south asia has increased by 12 percentage points over last 10 years notably across india nepal and pakistan. however that hard won progress could be undone by covid-19 related disruptions. countries that had recorded significant progress such as ethiopia and pakistan are now also at risk of backsliding if immunization services are not restored as soon as feasible. situation is especially concerning for latin america and caribbean where historically high coverage has slipped over last decade. in brazil bolivia haiti and venezuela immunization coverage plummeted by at least 14 percentage points since 2010. these countries are now also confronting moderate to severe covid19-related disruptions. as global health community attempts to recover lost ground due to covid-19 related disruptions unicef and who are supporting countries in their efforts to reimagine immunization and build back better by restoring services so countries can safely deliver routine immunization services during covid-19 pandemic by adhering to hygiene and physical distancing recommendations and providing protective equipment to health workers helping health workers communicate actively with caregivers to explain how services have been reconfigured to ensure safety;rectifying coverage and immunity gaps expanding routine services to reach missed communities where some of most vulnerable children live. notes to editorsdownload photos report data files and b

us$3.4 billion has been contributed to date resulting in a funding gap of us$27.9 billion of which 13.7 billion is urgently needed.pillar plans published today show a path to the accelerated development equitable allocation and scaled up delivery of 500 million tests to lmics by mid-2021 245 million courses of treatments to lmics by mid-2021 and 2 billion vaccine doses of which 1 billion will be purchased for lmics by the end of 2021.today the access to covid-19 tools accelerator act accelerator published its consolidated investment case alongside the costed plans of the member organizations.launched at the end of april 2020 at an event co hosted by the director general of the world health organization the president of france the president of the european commission and the bill melinda gates foundation the act accelerator brings together governments health organizations scientists businesses civil society and philanthropists who have joined forces to speedup an end to the pandemic.since the act accelerator was launched the partner organizations have moved fast to develop costed and implementable plans designed to contribute to the end of the pandemic through the accelerated development equitable allocation and scaled up delivery of new tools to reduce rapidly mortality and severe disease protecting health systems and restoring full societal and economic activity globally in the near term and facilitating high level control of covid-19 disease in the medium term.act accelerator investment case and costed plansthe act accelerators investment case and the plans published by the organizations leading each of the pillars show a path to the accelerated development equitable allocation and scaled up delivery of 500 million diagnostic tests to lmics by mid-2021 245 million courses of treatments to lmics by mid-2021 and 2 billion vaccine doses of which 50 will go to lmics by the end of 2021.to achieve this the costed plans presented today call for us 31.3 billion in funding for diagnostics therapeutics and vaccines of which us$3.4 billion has so far been pledged[2. an additional us$27.9 billion is therefore needed including us$13.7 billion to cover immediate needs i.e. us$17.1 billion is immediately required of which us$3.4 billion has been pledged).the investment required is significant but it pales in significance when compared to the cost of covid-19 the total cost of the act accelerator 's work is less than a tenth of what the imf estimates the global economy is losing every month due to the pandemic. 468,000 thousand people have already lost their lives.the tools developed will benefit the whole world the act accelerator pillars will also buy and deliver tools to ensure that lmics have access.the act accelerators investment case is available here.act accelerator pillarsthe act accelerator is led by the work of partner organizations collaborating under four pillars.the diagnostics pillar is co led by find and the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria and aims to save 9 million lives and avoid 1.6 billion further infections through the power of equitable access to simple accurate and affordable tests. with sufficient funding it can bring to market 23 high quality rapid tests train 10,000 healthcare professionals across 50 countries and establish testing for 500 million people in low- and middle income countries. its success will be determined by how quickly test trace and isolate strategies can be put in place to minimize disruption of health services and prepare countries for the effective roll out of therapeutics and vaccines once available. the investment case is available here.the therapeutics pillar is led by unitaid and the wellcome trust on behalf of the covid-19 therapeutics accelerator and seeks to accelerate the development and equitable delivery of treatments at all stages of disease ensuring they are accessible to all regardless of geography and level of economic resource. it targets development manufacture procurement and equitable distribution of 245 million courses of treatment for populations in low and middle income countries within 12 months. the investment case is available here.the vaccine pillar combines cepis leadership in vaccine development and investment in manufacturing with gavis track record in revolutionizing access and delivery and who s oversight of regulation policy and allocation. its role is to ensure that vaccines are developed as rapidly as possible manufactured at the right volumes without compromising on safety and delivered to those that need them most. the current estimate to deliver 2 billion doses by the end of 2021 assuming a safe and effective vaccine is developed in the near future is up to us$18.1 billion. in addition 950 million doses will need to be procured by self financing high income countries and upper middle income countries through the covax facility. these numbers will become clearer once we get a better idea of among other factors the technology that the successful vaccine candidates will be based on and the number of doses required to protect people from covid-19. the investment case is available here.the health systems connector is the fourth pillar of the act accelerator and supports the other three by ensuring that health systems and local community networks can fully utilize these and other essential tools in their battle against covid-19. this pillar is led by the world bank and the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria gfatm and supported by the who. it aims to build capacity such as laboratory capacity training for laboratory and health staff and management of protective equipment for health workers needed to deploy the new tools effectively when they are ready. it also works on system innovations to complement the rollout of products such as contact tracing social distancing and isolation approaches as well as community engagement needed to sustain them. global health security and the fight against covid-19 depends on shoring up health systems around the world now.call to actionsince its launch many governments and companies have signaled commitment to the act accelerator and made financial pledges. to date contributing countries have committed a total us$3.4. the funding gap is us$ 27.9 billion.on 27 june the global goal

equitable access to covid-19 vaccines worldwide. 75 countries which would finance vaccines from their own public finance budgets partner with up to 90 lower income countries that could be supported through voluntary donations to gavis covax advance market commitment amc. together this group of up to 165 countries represents more than 60 of worlds population. among group are representatives from every continent and more than half of worlds g20 economies. covax is only truly global solution to covid-19 pandemic said dr seth berkley ceo of gavi vaccine alliance. for vast majority of countries whether they can afford to pay for their own doses or require assistance it means receiving guaranteed share of doses and avoiding being pushed to back of queue as we saw during h1n1 pandemic decade ago. even for those countries that are able to secure their own agreements with vaccine manufacturers this mechanism represents through its world leading portfolio of vaccine candidates means of reducing risks associated with individual candidates failing to show efficacy or gain licensure. covax facility forms key part of covax pillar covax of access to covid-19 tools act accelerator ground breaking global collaboration to accelerate development production and equitable access to covid-19 tests treatments and vaccines. covax is co led by gavi coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi and who working in partnership with developed and developing country vaccine manufacturers. covax aims to accelerate development and manufacture of covid-19 vaccines and to guarantee fair and equitable access for every country in world. it will achieve this by sharing risks associated with vaccine development investing in manufacturing upfront so vaccines can be deployed at scale as soon as they are proven successful and pooling procurement and purchasing power to achieve sufficient volumes to end acute phase of pandemic by 2021. this early level of interest represents tremendous vote of confidence in covax and our shared goal to protect people around globe through fair allocation of covid-19 vaccine said dr richard hatchett ceo of cepi. covax offers innovative solution to gravest public health crisis in living memory. it will speed up availability of safe and effective vaccines through early investment in manufacturing capacity and maximise chances of success by backing broad and diverse portfolio of vaccine candidates. through covax our aspiration is to be able to vaccinate most vulnerable 20 of population of every country that participates regardless of income level by end of 2021. ensuring fair access is not only matter of equity it is fastest way to end this pandemic goal of covax is by end of 2021 to deliver two billion doses of safe effective vaccines that have passed regulatory approval and/or who prequalification. these vaccines will be delivered equally to all participating countries proportional to their populations initially prioritising healthcare workers then expanding to cover 20 of population of participating countries. further doses will then be made available based on country need vulnerability and covid-19 threat. covax facility will also maintain buffer of doses for emergency and humanitarian use including dealing with severe outbreaks before they spiral out of control. covid-19 pandemic like every health crisis also presents us with opportunities said dr soumya swaminathan who chief scientist. vaccine that is affordable and accessible to all will help us address systemic health inequalities. we need all countries to support covax to achieve this goal and bring end to acute phase of pandemic. success of these efforts will ultimately depend on securing enough funding from governments and commitments from vaccine manufacturers to participate at scale large enough to deliver global solution. formal expressions of interest submitted are non binding covax pillar will now begin process of consultation with all 165 countries with countries funding vaccines through their own domestic budgets being required to provide upfront payment and commitment to purchase doses by end of august to secure involvement in covax facility. significant progress has been achieved by covax partners to date with seven of nine candidate vaccines supported by cepi already in clinical trials. memorandum of understanding with astrazeneca also commits them to supply 300 million doses of covid-19 vaccines to covax. in addition in june gavi launched covax advance market commitment amc financing instrument aimed at incentivising vaccine manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of eventual covid-19 vaccines to ensure access for developing countries. amc has already raised close to us$ 600 million against initial target of us$ 2 billion from high income donors as well as private sector. gavi alliance will also work with developing countries to assure readiness of supply and cold chain and training to reach high risk groups. notes to editorsthe countries submitting expressions of interest include argentina armenia brazil canada czech republic estonia finland iceland ireland israel japan

covid 19 is disrupting life saving immunization services around the world putting millions of children in rich and poor countries alike at risk of diseases like diphtheria measles and polio. this stark warning comes from the world health organization unicef and gavi the vaccine alliance ahead of the global vaccine summit on 4 june at which world leaders will come together to help maintain immunization programmes and mitigate the impact of the pandemic in lower income countries. according to data collected by the world health organization unicef gavi and the sabin vaccine institute provision of routine immunization services is substantially hindered in at least 68 countries and is likely to affect approximately 80 million children under the age of 1 living in these countries. routine immunization of children disrupted since march 2020 routine childhood immunization services have been disrupted on a global scale that may be unprecedented since the inception of expanded programs on immunization epi in the 1970s. more than half 53 of the 129 countries where data were available reported moderate to severe disruptions or a total suspension of vaccination services during march april 2020.immunization is one of the most powerful and fundamental disease prevention tools in the history of public health said dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus who director general. disruption to immunization programmes from the covid-19 pandemic threatens to unwind decades of progress against vaccine preventable diseases like measles.at the 4 june global vaccine summit in london donors will pledge their support to gavi the vaccine alliance to sustain and accelerate this lifesaving work in some of the most vulnerable countries. from the bottom of my heart i urge donors to fully fund the alliance. these countries these children especially need vaccines and they need gavi.the reasons for disrupted services vary. some parents are reluctant to leave home because of restrictions on movement lack of information or because they fear infection with the covid-19 virus. and many health workers are unavailable because of restrictions on travel or redeployment to covid response duties as well as a lack of protective equipment.more children in more countries are now protected against more vaccine preventable diseases than at any point in history said dr. seth berkley gavi ceo. due to covid-19 this immense progress is now under threat risking the resurgence of diseases like measles and polio. not only will maintaining immunization programmes prevent more outbreaks it will also ensure we have the infrastructure we need to roll out an eventual covid-19 vaccine on a global scale.transport delays of vaccines are exacerbating the situation. unicef has reported a substantial delay in planned vaccine deliveries due to the lockdown measures and the ensuing decline in commercial flights and limited availability of charters. to help mitigate this unicef is appealing to governments the private sector the airline industry and others to free up freight space at an affordable cost for these life saving vaccines. gavi recently signed an agreement with unicef to provide advance funding to cover increased freight costs for delivery of vaccines in light of the reduced number of commercial flights available for transport.we can not let our fight against one disease come at the expense of long term progress in our fight against other diseases said henrietta fore unicef executive director. we have effective vaccines against measles polio and cholera. while circumstances may require us to temporarily pause some immunization efforts these immunizations must restart as soon as possible or we risk exchanging one deadly outbreak for another.next week who will issue new advice to countries on maintaining essential services during the pandemic including recommendations on how to provide immunizations safely.mass immunization campaigns temporarily disruptedmany countries have temporarily and justifiably suspended preventive mass vaccination campaigns against diseases like cholera measles meningitis polio tetanus typhoid and yellow fever due to risk of transmission and the need to maintain physical distancing during the early stages of the covid-19 pandemic. measles and polio vaccination campaigns in particular have been badly hit with measles campaigns suspended in 27 countries and polio campaigns put on hold in 38 countries. at least 24 million people in 21 gavi supported lower income countries are at risk of missing out on vaccines against polio measles typhoid yellow fever cholera rotavirus hpv meningitis a and rubella due to postponed campaigns and introductions of new vaccines. in late march concerned that mass gatherings for vaccination campaigns would enflame transmission of covid-19 who recommended countries to temporarily suspend preventive campaigns while assessments of risk and effective measures for reducing covid virus transmission were established.who has since monitored the situation and has now issued advice to help countries determine how and when to resume mass vaccination campaigns. the guidance notes that countries will need to make specific risk assessments based on the local dynamics of covid-19 transmission the health system capacities and the public health benefit of conducting preventive and outbreak response vaccination campaigns. based on this guidance and following growing concerns about increasing transmission of polio the global polio eradication initiative gpei is advising countries to start planning for the safe resumption of polio vaccination campaigns especially in polio high risk countries.despite the challenges several countries are making special efforts to continue immunization. uganda is ensuring that immunization services continue along with other essential health services even funding transportation to ensure outreach activities. and in lao pdr despite a national lockdown imposed in march routine immunization in fixed sites continued with physical distancing measures in place. notes to editorsdownload photos and broll from unicef and who.

"Understanding the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is important to comprehend factors that may play a role in mitigating the epidemic such as whether persons develop lasting immunity after recovery from infection and the optimal vaccine-induced immunity to provide adequate protection. Additionally, understanding the timing of antibody response and neutralizing activity can help direct optimal timing for convalescent plasma donation. Here we present three papers evaluating the magnitude, duration, and predictors of IgG, IgM, IgA, and neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2., Persistence and decay of human antibody responses to the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in COVID-19 patients.

the twenty fourth meeting of the emergency committee under the international health regulations 2005 ihr on the international spread of poliovirus was convened by the director general on 26 march 2020 with committee members only attending via teleconference supported by the who secretariat. in order to ease the burden on affected state parties in the exceptional situation following the determination of the covid-19 outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern pheic on 30 january 2020 characterized as a pandemic on 11 march 2020 the invited state parties were asked to present their reports electronically only instead of attending via teleconference. reports were received from afghanistan burkina faso central african republic cote divoire democratic republic of congo dr congo ethiopia ghana pakistan and philippines. the emergency committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus wpv1 and circulating vaccine derived polioviruses cvdpv. the who secretariat presented a report of progress for affected ihr states parties subject to temporary recommendations. wild poliovirus the committee remains gravely concerned by the significant increase in wpv1 cases globally in 2019 and 2020 with 175 cases in 2019 compared to 33 in 2018 and already 32 cases as at 17 march 2020 compared to six for the same period in 2019 with no significant success yet in reversing this trend. in pakistan transmission continues to be widespread as indicated by both acute flaccid paralysis afp surveillance and environmental sampling. while the issues of vaccine hesitancy and refusals by individuals and communities and problems with management of the national polio program are being addressed these are yet to have impact on the current worrying epidemiology. the added pressure on the program due to detection of cvdpv2 and ongoing spread in several provinces see below has continued into 2020. in afghanistan the security situation remains very challenging. inaccessibility and missed children particularly in the southern region have led to a large cohort of susceptible children in this part of afghanistan. the risk of a major upsurge of cases is growing with other parts of the country that have been free of wpv1 for some time now at risk of outbreaks. this would again increase the risk of international spread. the committee noted that based on sequencing of viruses there were recent instances of international spread of viruses from pakistan to afghanistan and also from afghanistan to pakistan. the recent increased frequency of wpv1 international spread between the two countries suggests that rising transmission in pakistan and afghanistan correlates with increasing risk of wpv1 exportation beyond the single epidemiological block formed by the two countries. the committee noted the continued cooperation and coordination between afghanistan and pakistan particularly in reaching high risk mobile populations that frequently cross the international border and welcomed the all age vaccination now being taken at key border points between the two countries. vaccine derived poliovirus vdpv the multiple cirulating vdpv cvdpv outbreaks in four who regions african eastern mediterranean south east asian and western pacific regions are very concerning with two new countries reporting outbreaks since the last meeting malaysia and burkina faso. unlike historical experience cross border spread of cvdpv2 has become quite common with recent spread from angola to dr congo and zambia and from chad and car to cameroon and from ghana to burkina faso. in addition local emergences attributable to mopv2 use have recently occurred in togo chad and ethiopia. the committee noted that the gpei has published a strategy to address cvdpv2 outbreaks but was extremely concerned that the monovalent opv2 stockpile was still depleted. the committee strongly supports the development and proposed emergency use listing of the novel opv2 vaccine which should become available mid-2020 and which it is hoped will result in no or very little seeding of further outbreaks. impact of covid-19 the committee noted the very recent policy guidance of the gpei gpei recommendations for countries during the covid-19 pandemic. this document summarizes the recommendations from the polio oversight board meeting on 24 march 2020 which calls for postponement of both preventive and outbreak response campaigns while ensuring surveillance and nopv2 development and roll out plans continue in full. the covid-19 polio programme continuity plan. the operational guide was developed in collaboration with the regional polio eradication teams and the gpei partners to ensure essential gpei functions continue polio programme personnel and staff are kept safe and to plan for a fast and effective resumption of polio eradication activities including supplementary immunization activities as soon as the public health situation with covid-19 allows. the committee is extremely concerned about the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the risk of heightened transmission of polio and consequently the potential for international spread and significant reversal of polio eradication. conclusion the committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a public health emergency of international concern pheic and recommended the extension of temporary recommendations for a further three months. however noting that some if not many international borders are closed to prevent international spread of covid-19 state parties may not currently be able to enforce the temporary recommendations in all places. the committee strongly urges countries subject to these recommendations to maintain a high state of readiness to implement them as soon as possible ensuring the continued safety of travelers as well as health professionals. the committee recognizes the concerns regarding the lengthy duration of the polio pheic but concludes that the current situation is extraordinary with clear ongoing risk of international spread and ongoing need for coordinated international response. the committee considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion rising risk of wpv1 international spread the progress made in recent years appears to have reversed with the committees assessment that the risk of international spread is at the highest point since 2014 when the pheic was declared. this risk assessment is based on the following the wpv1 exportation in 2019 from pakistan to iran and to afghanistan and more recently spread from afghanistan to pakistan;ongoing rise in the number of wpv1 cases and positive environmental samples in pakistan and to a lesser extent afghanistan;the quickly increasing cohort of unvaccinated children in afghanistan with the risk of a major outbreak imminent if nothing is done to access these children;the urgent need to overhaul the leadership and strategy of the program in pakistan which although already commenced is likely take some time to lead to more effective control of transmission and ultimately eradication;increasing community and individual resistance to the polio program.rising risk of cvdpv international spread the clearly documented increased spread in recent months of cvdpv2 demonstrate the unusual nature of the current situation as international spread of cvdpv in the past has been very infrequent. the number of new emergences of cvdpv2 in africa raises further concern. the risk of new outbreaks in new countries is considered extremely high even probable. covid-19 this new and unprecedented pandemic is likely to substantially negatively impact the polio eradication program and outbreak control efforts. there is a risk of exportation of both wpv1 and cvdpv to known high risk countries to which it may take a lot of time and effort to adequately respond.falling pv2 immunity global population mucosal immunity to type 2 polioviruses pv2 continues to fall as the cohort of children born after opv2 withdrawal grows exacerbated by poor coverage with ipv particularly in some of the cvdpv infected countries.multiple outbreaks the evolving and unusual epidemiology resulting in rapid emergence and evolution of cvdpv2 strains is extraordinary and not yet fully understood and represents an additional risk that is yet to be quantified.weak routine immunization many countries have weak immunization systems that can be further impacted by various humanitarian emergencies including covid19 and the number of countries in which immunization systems have been weakened or disrupted by conflict and complex emergencies poses a growing risk leaving populations in these fragile states vulnerable to outbreaks of polio. surveillance gaps the appearance of highly diverged vdpvs in the philippines somalia and indonesia are examples of inadequate polio surveillance heightening concerns that transmission could be missed in various countries. furthermore the missed transmission in china for a year illustrates that even countries with generally good surveillance can miss vdpv transmission. covid-19 is likely to have a negative impact on polio surveillance also.lack of access inaccessibility continues to be a major risk particularly in several countries currently infected with wpv or cvdpv i.e. afghanistan nigeria niger somalia and myanmar which all have sizable populations that have been unreached with polio vaccine for prolonged periods.population movement the risk is amplified by population movement whether for family social economic or cultural reasons or in the context of populations displaced by insecurity and returning refugees. there is a need for international coordination to address these risks. a regional approach and strong crossborder cooperation is required to respond to these risks as much international spread of polio occurs over land borders.risk categoriesthe committee provided the director general with the following advice aimed at reducing the risk of international spread of wpv1 and cvdpvs based on the risk stratification as follows states infected with wpv1 cvdpv1 or cvdpv3 with potential risk of international spread.states infected with cvdpv2 with potential risk of international spread.states no longer infected by wpv1 or cvdpv but which remain vulnerable to re infection by wpv or cvdpv.criteria to assess states as no longer infected by wpv1 or cvdpv poliovirus case 12 months after the onset date of the most recent case plus one month to account for case detection investigation laboratory testing and reporting period or when all reported afp cases with onset within 12 months of last case have been tested for polio and excluded for wpv1 or cvdpv and environmental or other samples collected within 12 months of the last case have also tested negative whichever is the longer.environmental or other isolation of wpv1 or cvdpv no poliovirus case 12 months after collection of the most recent positive environmental or other sample such as from a healthy child plus one month to account for the laboratory testing and reporting periodthese criteria may be varied for the endemic countries where more rigorous assessment is needed in reference to surveillance gaps e.g. borno state nigeria)once a country meets these criteria as no longer infected the country will be considered vulnerable for a further 12 months. after this period the country will no longer be subject to temporary recommendations unless the committee has concerns based on the final report. |1

vaccine manufacturing and to scale up productionthe united nations and its partners today welcomed monumental show of solidarity as governments private sector civil society and international organizations committed support to access to covid-19 tools- act accelerator initiative launched by world health organization alongside international partners.today nearly us$1 billion in new financing has been committed to initiative worlds most comprehensive multilateral end to end solution to devastating covid-19 pandemic.the act accelerator which wasco launched bythe world health organization european commission france and bill melinda gates foundationjust five months ago needs additional us$35 billion to realize its goals of producing 2 billion vaccine doses 245 million treatments and 500 million tests. new commitments to initiative are welcome and will be leveraged to catalyze further funding to continue act accelerators groundbreaking work.most urgently act accelerator requires us$15 billion to support immediate capacity buildingfor research and development manufacturing procurement and delivery systemsby end of year.convening high level event at 75th session of un general assembly to urgently mobilize support for act accelerator secretary general antnio guterres commended on extraordinary international effort to address human crisis like no other in our lifetimes adding that more efforts must be made to further deepen remarkable progress so far.it is in every countrys national and economic self interest to work together to massively expand access to tests and treatments and to support vaccine as global public gooda peoples vaccine available and affordable for everyone everywhere.the act acceleratorincluding its covax facilityis vehicle to get us there. investing in act accelerator will accelerate every countrys own recovery said mr. guterres who co hosted event with united kingdoms foreign secretary dominic raab south africas health minister zweli mkhize and director general of world health organization dr. tedros adhanom ghebreyesus.unprecedented global collaborationthe act accelerator which was launched just five months ago is unprecedented global collaboration of worlds top international health organizations working together to accelerate development production and equitable delivery of covid-19 tests treatments and vaccines.we have duty to ensure vaccines treatments and tests for covid-19 are available to allstopping global spread of pandemic protects british people and will put humanity on road to recovery. collaboration through act accelerator is critical to promoting development production and access for all countries said uk foreign secretary dominic raab.the united kingdom recently committed up to 571 m approximately us$ 732 m for covax. this includes up to 500 m for gavi advanced market commitment for covid-19 covax amc vaccinesa financing instrument that incentivises vaccine manufacturers to produce sufficient covid-19 vaccines to ensure access for developing countries.today uk foreign secretary called for more support pledging that this 500 m commitment would include 1 is$ 1.29 in matched funding for every us$4 committed by others for up to 250 m approximately us$ 321m).germany canada and sweden have also made new commitments to covax amc of euro 100 million cad$ 220 million and us$ 10 million respectively. these are eligible for matching with todays uk matching commitment.science is giving us solutions in form of new tests therapeutics andhopefullya vaccine. but science and solutions will be ineffective without solidarity said dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus who director general.i am grateful for generous financial commitments made today but we still have significant funding gap to close. fully financing act accelerator will help to control pandemic restore confidence and stimulate global recovery. frankly this is not financial challenge its test of solidarity. this is moment for saying no to nationalism and yes to our shared humanity. because ultimately act accelerator is not delivering merely vaccines diagnostics and therapeutics. its delivering something far more importanthope.we must confront this health crisis as global challenge together in solidarity and cooperation with one another working toward global solution. we have to generate key tests treatments and vaccines that we all need and make sure they are distributed equitably to people who most need them regardless of where they live and whether their country is wealthy or not said south africas health ministerzweli mkhize adding that large parts of population especially in developing countries remain vulnerable and marginalized during this pandemic.todays event highlighted substantial results achieved by access to covid-19 tools accelerator initiative since its launch availability of 120 million affordable and high quality rapid tests for low- and middle income countries breakthrough in trials with and rapid rollout of dexamethasonethe only drug found to make significant difference to patient mortality creation of covax facility global mechanism to ensure equitable access to eventual covid-19 vaccines regardless of income -comprising 168 economies and largest and most diverse vaccine portfolio in world with nine candidate vaccines under evaluation eight of them in clinical trials.in another significant show of support coalition of 16 pharmaceutical companies and bill melinda gates foundation signed agreement to cooperate on vaccine manufacturing and to scale up production at unprecedented speed ensuring that approved vaccines are more broadly accessible and distributed as early as possible. bill gates co chair of bill melinda gates foundation said one thing i 've learned studying history of pandemics is that they create surprising dynamic when it comes to self interest and altruism. pandemics are rare cases where countrys instinct to help itself is tightly aligned with its instinct to help others. self interested thing and altruistic thingmaking sure poor nations have access to vaccinesare oneandthe same.a number of countries most recently united kingdom and canada are good models for what other wealthy nations should do. they have donated enough money for covax vaccine pillar of act accelerator to procure probably hundreds of millions of vaccine doses for poor countries. but more will be needed and i hope wealthy nations will continue to be generous.the world bank unveiled plans this week for significant financial commitment to support developing countries to purchase covid-19 vaccines as soon as they are available.world bank president david malpass said that once plans are ratified by stakeholders having up to us$ 12 billion available in finance will be game changer because once safe and effective vaccine is available it will allow people to resume their lives with confidence.investing in global recoverythe act accelerator investment case illustrates considerable economic benefits of collectively accelerating development and deployment of tools to rapidly reduce risk of severe covid-19 disease globally. prior to unga 2020 act accelerator has raised us$3 billion out of need of us$38 billion. more detail can be found in act accelerator investment case.the economic rationale for investing in approach that can accelerate end of covid-19 crisis remains clear.fully financing initiative to help shorten duration of crisis would pay back this investment in less than 36 hours once global mobility and trade alone are restored.notes to editorsthe access to covid-19 tools act accelerator is proven up and running global collaboration to accelerate development production and equitable access to covid-19 tests treatments and vaccines. it was set up in response to call from g20 leaders in march and launched by who european commission france and bill melinda gates foundation in april 2020.the act accelerator is not decision making body or new organization it works to speed up collaborative efforts among existing organizations to end pandemic. it is framework for collaboration that has been designed to bring key players around table with goal of ending pandemic as quickly as possible through accelerated development equitable allocation and scaled up delivery of tests treatments and vaccines thereby protecting health systems and restoring societies and economies in near term.it draws on experience of leading global health organizations which are tackling worlds toughest health challenges and who by working together are able to unlock new and more ambitious results against covid-19. its members share commitment to ensure all people have access to all tools needed to defeat covid-19 and to work with unprecedented levels of partnership to achieve it.the act accelerator comprises four pillars diagnostics therapeutics vaccines and

africa centres for disease control and prevention africa cdc unitaid find chai and their partnersthis is latest move from access to covid-19 tools act accelerator to develop procure and distribute critical new tools to fight pandemic new tests are urgently needed to meet huge unmet needs for testing worldwidea set of agreements to make available for low and middle income countries affordable high quality covid-19 antigen rapid tests were today announced by access to covid-19 tools act accelerator. organizations involved in milestone agreement include africa centres for disease control and prevention africa cdc bill melinda gates foundation clinton health access initiative chai foundation for innovative new diagnostics find global fund unitaid and world health organization who).as part of this comprehensive end to end effort bill melinda gates foundation has executed separate volume guarantee agreements with rapid diagnostic test rdt producers abbott and sd biosensor. these two arrangements will make available to lmics 120 million antigen rapid diagnostic tests ag rdts priced at maximum of us$5 per unit over period of six months. these tests provide results in 1530 minutes rather than hours or days and will enable expansion of testing particularly in countries that do not have extensive laboratory facilities or trained health workers to implement molecular polymerase chain reaction or pcr tests.the tests developed by abbott and sd biosensor are highly portable reliable and easy to administer making testing possible in near person decentralized healthcare settings. both companies tests are faster and cheaper than laboratory based tests enabling countries to increase pace of testing tracing and treating people for covid-19 at point of care particularly in areas with under resourced health systems. number of other ag rdts are at various stages of development and assessment.to scale up ag rdts global fund today announced that it has made available initial us$50 million from its covid-19 response mechanism to enable countries to purchase at least 10 million of new rapid tests for lmics at guaranteed price with first orders expected to be placed this week through global funds pooled procurement mechanism.find and who are working together to accelerate appropriate use by supporting implementation research that will optimize ag rdt use in multiple lmics in line with who guidance. this includes provision of catalytic volumes of tests to understand how ag rdts can best fit into health systems.unitaid and africa cdc will combine resources to initiate roll out of these tests in up to 20 countries in africa starting in october 2020. this multi million dollar intervention currently undergoing final sign off by their boards is designed to engage multiple partners active in covid-19 response in these countries such as chai african society for laboratory medicine aslm and local organizations. this will bolster efforts by african unions partnership to accelerate covid-19 testing pact initiative launched in august 2020 to mobilize experts community workers supplies and other resources to minimize impact of pandemic on african continent by testing tracing and treating covid-19 cases in timely manner.testing is critical cornerstone of covid-19 response enabling countries to trace and contain virus now and to prepare for roll out of vaccines once available. effective testing strategies rely on portfolio of test types that can be used in different settings and situations. while molecular tests started to be rolled out within month of virus being sequenced these tests are mainly laboratory based relying on infrastructure and trained personnel to conduct them. rapid tests to detect presence of virus at point of care which are faster and cheaper are vital addition to testing arsenal needed to contain and fight covid-19.who guidance published on 11 september 2020 highlights value of these tests in areas where community transmission is widespread and where nucleic acid amplification based diagnostic naat testing is either unavailable or where test results are significantly delayed. as well as supporting test trace isolate strategies tests can help identify or confirm new outbreaks support outbreak investigations through screening monitor disease trends and potentially test asymptomatic contacts.the act accelerator diagnostics pillar is co convened by find and global fund working closely with who and over 30 global health expert partners to accelerate innovation and overcome technical financial and political obstacles to achieving equitable access to effective and timely testing. such unprecedented global collaboration has enabled development and deployment of first who eul approved ag rdt within eight months of first identification of virus. in comparison it took nearly five years to develop first rdt for hiv. several more antigen rdts for covid-19 are currently under who eul review. overall act accelerator diagnostic pillar aims to facilitate supply of 500 million tests to lmics within 12 months.these agreements are critical to fulfil key objective of act accelerator to ensure all countries regardless of income have fair access to new tests and tools to fight covid-19. exceptional speed with which ag rdt access package has been created demonstrates breadth of impact of act accelerator initiative and this and future achievements in testing will complement similar milestones anticipated to emerge from vaccines and therapeutics pillars.dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus director general of who said high quality rapid tests show us where virus is hiding which is key to quickly tracing and isolating contacts and breaking chains of transmission. tests are critical tool for governments as they look to reopen economies and ultimately save both lives and livelihoods.mark suzman chief executive officer of gates foundation said testing is essential tool in fight against covid-19. we are delighted to join partnership that will help ensure that latest high quality diagnostics do not just go to highest bidder but will be available at affordable price to worlds lower income countries. in addition all of actions announced today point to growing success of act accelerator in catalyzing global cooperation for fair and effective response to this global crisis.dr iain barton chief executive officer of chai said these agreements will help ensure that millions of people in low- and middle income countries have access to high quality rapid testing in villages and towns as well as cities. this has potential to revolutionize governments ability to respond to pandemic enabling quick diagnosis and response to contain localized virus outbreaks before they spread.andrea f. wainer executive vice president of abbotts rapid and molecular diagnostics businesses said abbott is pleased to bring our panbio covid-19 rapid antigen test and sympheos digital solution to people and health authorities in low- and middle income countries through this innovative partnership. we have long been committed to making sure our life changing technologies are affordable and accessible and for decades have been supporting many of these countries with our rapid tests for malaria hiv hepatitis and other deadly infectious diseases.hyo keun lee chief executive officer of sd biosensor said we sd biosensor are pleased to supply our standard q covid-19 rapid antigen tests for people who really need fast and accurate covid-19 diagnosis. through this partnership we will keep striving do our best to provide best quality of covid-19 antigen rapid kits for fighting covid-19.dr john nkengasong director of africa cdc said antigen tests are important complement to pcr testing and are crucial to expand testing capacity throughout africa. beauty of antigen testing is that it is fast and gives quick results. it will allow healthcare workers to quickly isolate cases and treat them while tracing their contacts to cut transmission chain.dr philippe duneton unitaids executive director a.i. said access to these point of care rapid tests with be game changer in fight against covid-19. we are working to support countries to rapidly deploy and use these new tests in best possible way. todays news shows what act partners working together can deliver in our efforts against covid-19 pandemic.dr carolyn gomes special advisor for board proactividad jamaica and alternate board member developing country ngos global fund ensuring equitable access to rapid diagnostic tests is essential for controlling covid-19 in all countries and to opening up economies across world. ensuring affordable price is major step forward. tests that can be used at point of care by front line workers will greatly facilitate community access to testing. to ensure equity in access for those who need it most there will need to be much greater support of act accelerator and diagnostics pillar in particular. much more money is needed to meet needs of most vulnerable. peter sands executive director of global fund said this is act accelerator in action. it is proof that by working together at massive global scale we can develop and deploy vital new tool to help contain and fight pandemic. this is not just new test its money and deployment plan to get it to where its needed fast. this is power of global collaboration.dr catharina boehme chief executive officer of find said with this ag rdt package act accelerator partners have secured much needed tools for lmics to dramatically increase covid-19 testing. with financial support of several countries we have made great progress but to ensure we reach all those who need testing and bring prices down we urgently need substantial funding from public philanthropic and multilateral sources.about act acceleratorthe access to covid-19 tools act accelerator is new ground breaking global collaboration to accelerate
